    <p>Your story....</p>
    <p>(First Word)! Did your grandpa ever ask you to pull his finger? My grandpa (boy’s name) used to do that all of the time. He would either be pulling my sister (girl’s name)’s toes or be walking around asking us to pull his finger. I’d like to tell
      you a story about my grandpa, (boy’s name). He’s kind, emotional, and a bit kooky. I love my grandpa, but he has never been the most appropriate person. He is a great person, and he looks great in (favorite color). He (emotion)’s (favorite animal)’s,
      the color (eyes) and the movie (age) years of singing like a (favorite animal). In fact, he (emotion) ‘s it so much that he doesn’t go a (holiday) without making the whole family watch it with him. I will only be sharing a few stories about my grandpa
      because the number of them is just too great. Sit back relax and enjoy the laughs, (first word)!</p>
  

    <p>There was this other time last (season) that grandpa (action)ed all the way to Hawaii. It was a sight to see. He did this all while dressed up as his favorite (Villain) costume. He painted his face (color) and (action) around in circles screaming,
      “First Word! Help I’ve lost my (favorite animal), it’s fur is (eye color) and (favorite color). My poor, (favorite animal) is (age) and dressed in a (superhero) costume.” Grandpa began to be overwhelmed by extreme (emotion). Grandma said to him,
      “Are you hungry, let’s go get you some (ice cream) ice cream, it’s your favorite.” Grandpa screamed, (action)ed and yelled, “(girl’s name), why are you standing there with your (eyes) beady eyes. (boy’s name) is missing!” “(First Word)!” We never
      knew what would be coming out of grandpa’s mouth. He did this at the local bowling alley in front of all of our family, and friends. </p>

    <p>(First Word)! Did your grandpa ever ask you to pull his finger? My grandpa (boy’s name) used to do that all of the time. He would either be pulling my sister (girl’s name)’s toes or be walking around asking us to pull his finger. We were even in (place)
      eating (ice cream) ice cream watching (Super Hero) and (Villain) wrestle with (favorite animal)’s, when he yelled out, “(first word)!” Everyone just stopped and stared at us I was so embarrassed. This was the first time of many embarrassing experiences
      with my grandpa. </p>

    <p>Poor grandma (girl’s name), She couldn’t take grandpa anywhere. When we were in (place) he decided to go to the zoo and (action) until his complexion turned (eye color). He (action)ed until (superhero) the zookeeper came to the rescue and put him
      into the (animal)’s pen. He was like the energizer bunny. He kept going and going and going and going. He (action) until (holiday). Grandma saw this and got (emotion)al. In fact, she’s so (emotion)al that she got onto a plane and left grandpa in
      (place) until (season). </p>

    <p>Another time, we were at my aunt’s house for (holiday) when he asked my boyfriend at the time if he would look at his bright (favorite color) bugger. My poor boyfriend, it was only our third date. He was (age) and I was (age) years older than him.
      He took it like a champ, he looked at the bugger and said it looks like (ice cream) ice cream. He got really (emotion) and then he (action). This story doesn’t end here. My aunt walks into the room and asks my boyfriend if he would like to cut the
      cheese, and he says, “(Yes, No)” and he lets one rip. Everyone looked at each other and laughed and said, “(First Word)! Welcome to the family.”
