      <p><strong>(First Word)</strong>! Did your grandpa ever ask you to pull his finger? My grandpa <strong>(boy’s name)</strong> used to do that all of the time. He would either be pulling my sister <strong>(girl’s name)</strong>’s toes or be walking around asking us to pull his finger. I’d like to tell
        you a story about my grandpa, <strong>(boy’s name)</strong>. He’s kind, emotional, and a bit kooky. I love my grandpa, but he has never been the most appropriate person. He is a great person, and he looks great in <strong>(favorite color)</strong>. He <strong>(emotion)</strong>’s <strong>(favorite animal)</strong>’s,
        the color <strong>(eyes)</strong> and the movie <strong>(age)</strong> years of singing like a <strong>(favorite animal)</strong>. In fact, he <strong>(emotion)</strong>‘s it so much that he doesn’t go a <strong>(holiday)</strong> without making the whole family watch it with him. I will only be sharing a few stories about my
        grandpa because the number of them is just too great. Sit back relax and enjoy the laughs, <strong>(first word)</strong>!</p>


      <p>There was this other time last <strong>(season)</strong> that grandpa <strong>(action)</strong>ed all the way to Hawaii. It was a sight to see. He did this all while dressed up as his favorite <strong>(Villain)</strong> costume. He painted his face <strong>(color)</strong> and <strong>(action)</strong> around in circles screaming,
        “<strong>(First Word)</strong>! Help I’ve lost my <strong>(favorite animal)</strong>, it’s fur is <strong>(eye color)</strong> and <strong>(favorite color)</strong>. My poor, <strong>(favorite animal)</strong> is <strong>(age)</strong> and dressed in a <strong>(superhero)</strong>costume.” Grandpa began to be overwhelmed by extreme <strong>(emotion)</strong>. Grandma said to him,
        “Are you hungry, let’s go get you some <strong>(ice cream)</strong> ice cream, it’s your favorite.” Grandpa screamed, <strong>(action)</strong>ed and yelled, “<strong>(girl’s name)</strong>, why are you standing there with your <strong>(eyes)</strong> beady eyes. <strong>(boy’s name)</strong> is missing!” “<strong>(First Word)</strong>!” We never
        knew what would be coming out of grandpa’s mouth. He did this at the local bowling alley in front of all of our family, and friends. </p>

      <p><strong>(First Word)</strong>! Did your grandpa ever ask you to pull his finger? My grandpa <strong>(boy’s name)</strong> used to do that all of the time. He would either be pulling my sister <strong>(girl’s name)</strong>’s toes or be walking around asking us to pull his finger. We were even in
        <strong>(place)</strong> eating <strong>(ice cream)</strong> ice cream watching <strong>(Super Hero)</strong> and <strong>(Villain)</strong> wrestle with <strong>(favorite animal)</strong>’s, when he yelled out, “<strong>(first word)</strong>!” Everyone just stopped and stared at us I was so embarrassed. This was the first time of many embarrassing
        experiences with my grandpa. </p>

      <p>Poor grandma <strong>(girl’s name)</strong>, She couldn’t take grandpa anywhere. When we were in <strong>(place)</strong> he decided to go to the zoo and <strong>(action)</strong> until his complexion turned <strong>(eye color)</strong>. He <strong>(action)</strong>ed until <strong>(superhero)</strong> the zookeeper came to the rescue and put him
        into the <strong>(animal)</strong>’s pen. He was like the energizer bunny. He kept going and going and going and going. He <strong>(action)</strong> until <strong>(holiday)</strong>. Grandma saw this and got <strong>(emotion)</strong>al. In fact, she’s so <strong>(emotion)</strong>al that she got onto a plane and left grandpa
        in <strong>(place) until <strong>(season). </p>

      <p>Another time, we were at my aunt’s house for <strong>(holiday)</strong> when he asked my boyfriend at the time if he would look at his bright <strong>(favorite color)</strong> bugger. My poor boyfriend, it was only our third date. He was <strong>(age)</strong> and I was <strong>(age)</strong> years older than him.
        He took it like a champ, he looked at the bugger and said it looks like <strong>(ice cream)</strong> ice cream. He got really <strong>(emotion)</strong> and then he <strong>(action)</strong>. This story doesn’t end here. My aunt walks into the room and asks my boyfriend if he would like to cut
        the cheese, and he says, “<strong>(Yes, No)</strong>” and he lets one rip. Everyone looked at each other and laughed and said, “<strong>(First Word)</strong>! Welcome to the family.”</p>
